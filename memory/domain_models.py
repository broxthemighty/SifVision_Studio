Purpose:
This file defines the core domain model for the Learnflow Base application.
It contains the enumerations and data structures used to represent user
learning activity.
    - Introducing a LearningLog class (objects instead of raw strings).
    - Storing multiple entries per type (lists of logs).
    - Adding timestamp and optional mood fields for future analysis.
This separation allows the GUI (ui.py) and business logic (service.py)
to be improved while still sharing a consistent data model.
